Running this application is a 2 step process, first change into the "complete" directory.
To run the server application use the `./gradlew server:bootRun` command which will start the
application on port 8080. While this is starting up, open a second terminal window and navigate
back to the "complete" directory. Once in the proper location start your front end using
`./gradlew client:bootRun` which will start the client on port 3000. At this point you should
be able to navigate to localhost:3000 and see the home page with a message that reads
"Welcome to the Garage"
