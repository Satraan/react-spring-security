Next we create our react lifecycle method.

----
componentDidMount() {
    if (Auth.loggedIn()) {
        this.setState({route: 'garage'})
    }
}
----

Here we are using a method we created in our `Auth` object to see if we are currently logged in. If we
are then we set our current route in state to 'garage', if not we leave the route set to 'login'.

Now lets take a look at how we will handle simple routing.
