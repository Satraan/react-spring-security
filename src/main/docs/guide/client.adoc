While our application is a minimal example of how to connect React to Spring Security it is always
important to keep good design in mind even with small applications. This will help positive design
decision to be second nature
when you are working on larger projects in the future. So with that in mind we have chosen to include
the concept of handlers in this guide, as while it is an extra step and most certainly not necessary for such an simple
application, it is a very easy concept and will exemplify how to write nice clean code and will
demonstrate how handlers can be used to reduce some types of code duplication.
