As we mentioned earlier when we added <<loginScreen>>, in order to capture input change we require
a change handler.


[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=62..69]
----

Our handler can be used for both username and password as our `target` object contains both the field names
and values.
