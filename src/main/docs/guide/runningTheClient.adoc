Once your second terminal is open run the following

[source,bash]
----
cd complete/
----

Now in the proper location start your front end

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew client:bootRun
----
This will start the client on port 3000. At this point you should
be able to navigate to `localhost:3000` and see the home page with a message that reads
"Welcome to the Garage"
