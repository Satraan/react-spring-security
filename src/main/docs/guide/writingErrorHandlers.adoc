Similarly to our `checkStatusResponse` handler method we now have our `defaultErrorHandler` which can receive an incoming
error along with an additional function.

----
export const defaultErrorHandler = (error, handler) => {
    console.error(error);

    if(handler) {
        handler.call();
    }
};
----

`defaultErrorHandler` is pretty simple, if an error is present it will log the error. If an additional function is passed in
it will then execute that function as well.
