Similarly to our `checkStatusResponse` handler method we now have our `defaultErrorHandler` which can receive an incoming
error along with an additional function.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/handlers/errorHandlers.js

`defaultErrorHandler` is pretty simple, if an error is present it will log the error. If an additional function is passed in
it will then execute that function as well.
