Now that Spring Security has been added to our application we need to run the basic Spring Security
configuration. Helpfully this is included in the plugin so make sure you are in the correct location ...

[source,bash]
----
cd complete/server
----

Then execute the following

[source, bash]
----
grails s2-quickstart react-spring-security User Role
----

This should generate the following files

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/User.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/Role.groovy[]
----

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/UserRole.groovy[]
