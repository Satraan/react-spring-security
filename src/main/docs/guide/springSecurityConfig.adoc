Now that Spring Security has been added to our application, we can generate the default Spring Security
configuration. The plugin provides a `s2-quickstart` command that will generate a set of domain classes and configuration to get us started.

[source,bash]
----
cd complete/server
----

Then execute the following

[source, bash]
----
grails s2-quickstart react-spring-security User Role
----

This should generate the following domain classes:

[source]
----
/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/User.groovy
/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/Role.groovy
/server/grails-app/domain/react/spring/security/UserRole.groovy
----

In addition, the Spring Security Rest plugin has added some extra configuration at `server/grails-app/conf/application.groovy` to configure our stateless filter chain (which will support token-based authentication.

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/server/grails-app/conf/application.groovy[]
----

Please refer to the Spring Security REST documentation for more details.
