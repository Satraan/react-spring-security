Our `checkResponseStatus` handler is responsible for checking the returned http status code and can be
used anywhere we are using `fetch` to find out which status was returned.

----
export const checkResponseStatus = (response) => {
    if(response.status >= 200 && response.status < 300) {
        return response.json()
    } else {
        let error = new Error('Incorrect username or password ' + response.statusText);
        error.response = response;
        throw error;
    }
};
----

A quick break down of the above function is that it will receive the response from the http call and
will validate if the status is within an acceptable range and if it is, then it will return the JSON data. If the value is outside of that range it
will return an error to the calling method.
