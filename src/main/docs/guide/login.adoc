Finally lets look at our actual login process and finish connecting everything up. This is the glue to
everything we have already done at this point and makes use of our 2 response handlers and our error
handler as well as using class specific custom handlers to deal with our current state.

First lets
look out our login function. Our login function takes an event that we call `e.preventDefault();` on.
The reason we do this is without this call our next call using the fetch api will try to look at the
client url rather than the server url.

Second we look at the actual fetch call. This is calling back to the Spring Security login end point in
our server and is passing it our user object (which contains our credentials captured from the login
screen).

Third we are leveraging our `checkResponseStatus` handler to validate that we got a correct response from
the server.

Fourth we are using our `loginResponseHandler` to login.

Fifth in the even we have an error we use our `defaultErrorHandler` to neatly deal with the error.

----
login = (e) => {
    console.log('App:login');
    e.preventDefault(); <1>

    fetch(`${SERVER_URL}/api/login`, { <2>
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(this.state.user)
    }).then(checkResponseStatus) <3>
      .then(response => loginResponseHandler(response, this.customLoginHandler)) <4>
      .catch(error => defaultErrorHandler(error, this.customErrorHandler)); <5>
    console.log('END App:login');
};

customLoginHandler = () => { <6>
    console.log('customLoginHandler');
    this.setState({route: 'garage'});
};

customErrorHandler = (error) => { <7>
    this.reset();
    this.setState({error: error.message});
};
----

Now if you recall when we wrote our handlers we have the ability for them to accept additional handlers.
These additional handlers are how we deal with being able to set state in one component from another.
In this case we use our 6) `customLoginHandler` to set our new route on a successful login. If we are
not successful then we use 7) `customErrorHandler` and we clear our login form data and set the error message.
