At this point we have an almost fully functional app and you should be able to login and logout, only
issue left is when you login, rest calls back to our server are not authenticated yet. If you look in
your browser console you will see url calls that are throwing a 401 error. To fix this we need to pass
our authentication token with our calls.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/garage.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/garage.js[indent=0,lines=21..86]
----

In order to authenticate our calls we need to add an additional `Authorization` header with a value of
`'Bearer ' + JSON.parse(localStorage.auth).access_token`. Once added to the calls our app should be fully
functioning and secured. If you are not already running the application go back to <<runningTheApp>> and start the server
and client.
