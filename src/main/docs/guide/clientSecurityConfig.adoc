At this point we will begin adding the necessary security configuration to the client. Don't
worry as adding this next portion is just the start and security will not actually be enabled
just yet. We will cover that later when we connect everything up.

to create a two files

Create the following new files in your new `security` directory

- Auth.js
- Login.js
