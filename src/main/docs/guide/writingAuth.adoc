We will start in Auth.js file as there are no dependencies for this file. Auth.js will have the three
following functions and we will be making use of HTML5's `localStorage` object.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/security/Auth.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/security/Auth.js[]
----

<1> Our login function is fairly simple as it will take in an auth object and so long as its not null we
will convert it to a JSON string and store it in our `localStorage` at `localStorage.auth` for later
use.

<2> Logout is actually even simpler as it doesn't require any arguments or perform any checks. When logOut
is called we simply remove the data that is stored at `localStorage.auth`.

<3> Finally it might be useful to be able to check if we are logged in. So in this case we return a simple
boolean of whether or not auth exists in `localStorage`.

Now that we have our base of client side authentication in place lets move on.
