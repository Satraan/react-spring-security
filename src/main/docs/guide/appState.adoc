First thing, let's build our `App` state object. You should recognize our user and error fields in our state as
we have used them already in some of our functions. In addition, we'll add a `route` variable for use later on.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=12..23]
----

In addition to creating our initial state, we will also add a `reset` function so that we can easily return
to our initial state when needed:


[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=46..55]
