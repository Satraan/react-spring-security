First thing lets get our state object built. You should recognize our user and error fields in our state as
we have used them already in some of our functions, additionally we add a route field that maintains
our default application path.

----
constructor() {
    super();

    this.state = {
        user: {
            username: '',
            password: ''
        },
        route: 'login',
        error: null
    }
}
----

In addition to creating out initial state we will also create a `reset` function so that we can return
to our initial state later on.

----
reset = () => {
    this.setState({
        user: {
            username: '',
            password: ''
        },
        route: 'login',
        error: null
    });
};
