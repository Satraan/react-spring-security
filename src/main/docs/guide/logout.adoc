Now to ensure completeness we want to add the ability to logout as well. As seen above in our
<<routing>>, when we are routed to the garage we are passing a logoutHandler

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=104..104]
----

The logout handler simply calls the `Auth.logOut()` function we wrote earlier.  We then call `reset()`, which gets us back our initial state.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=91..94]
----

Lastly, in our `Garage` component, we need to add a logout button:

[source, javascript]
.client/src/Garage.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/Garage.js[indent=0,lines=81..81]
----

When this button is clicked, React will execute the `logoutHandler` function.
