Now to ensure completeness we want to add the ability to logout as well. As seen above in our
<<routing>>, when we are routed to the garage we are passing a logoutHandler

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=96..96]
----

The logout handler simply calls the `Auth.logOut()` function we wrote earlier which `delete localStorage.auth`.
and we call `reset()` which resets us to our initial state.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/App.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/App.js[indent=0,lines=81..84]
----

Lastly we need to add a logout button.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/garage.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/garage.js[indent=0,lines=95..95]
----

Our button is calling our passed in logoutHandler and executing the action.
At this point you should now be able to successfully logout.
