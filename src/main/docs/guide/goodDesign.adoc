Good design is always something you should keep in mind even for small example projects like this one as it makes it more
like second nature when you are working on larger projects in the future. So with that in mind I have chosen to include
the concept of handlers in this guide as while it is an extra step and most certainly not necessary for such an simple
application, it is a very simple concept and will exemplify how to write nice clean code and will demonstrate how easily
handlers can be used to reduce some types of code duplication.
