Now that all our independent components are in place we are going to start tying things together.
The first step to connecting our code together will be adding an additional handler for login. This new
handler will be responsible for actually executing our `Auth.login(response)` that we wrote in the last
section.

[source, javascript]
.client/src/handlers/responseHandlers.js
----
include::{sourceDir}/client/src/handlers/responseHandlers.js[indent=0,lines=14..23]
----

The above handler is similar to our `defaultErrorHandler` as it takes in a response and possibly an
additional function. If an additional function is passed in it will then execute that function as well.
