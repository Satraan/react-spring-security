Now that all our independent components are in place we are going to start tying things together a bit.
The first step to connecting our code together will be adding an additional handler for login. This new
handler will be responsible for actually executing our `Auth.login(response)` that we wrote in the last
section.

----
import Auth from '../security/Auth';

export const loginResponseHandler = (response, handler) => {
    Auth.logIn(response);

    if(handler) {
        console.log('Custom login handler has been called');
        handler.call();
    }
};
----

The above handler is similar to our `defaultErrorHandler` as it takes in a response and possibly an
additional function. If an additional function is passed in it will then execute that function as well.
