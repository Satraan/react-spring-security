We dynamically select which route we want to navigate to based off the current value stored in our
state.route using our `contentForRoute` function which is then called in our render in order to return
the proper component. Looking at our `contentForRoute` the calls to login should look familiar as here
is where we are passing in our data and functions.

NOTE: We pull error, user, and route into their own variables for clarity. They could just
as easily be written this.state.error, this.state.user, ect...

CAUTION: Make certain to pay attention to how functions are passed. If the function is passed by
reference `onSubmit={this.login}` the function will execute later when interacted with. If the
function is passed as `onSubmit={this.login()}` it will execute on the return statement and you could
have strange or unwanted behavior.
