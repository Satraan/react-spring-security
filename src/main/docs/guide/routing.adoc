We dynamically select which route we want to navigate to based off the current value stored in our
state.route using our `contentForRoute` function which is then called in our render in order to return
the proper component. Looking at our `contentForRoute` the calls to login should look familiar as here
is where we are passing in our data and functions.

****
Note: 1)
We pull error, user, and route into their own variables for clarity. They could just
as easily be written this.state.error, this.state.user.

contentForRoute() {
    const {error, user, route} = this.state <1>
    console.log('contentForRoute: ' + route);
    switch (route) {
        case 'login':
            return <Login error={error}
                          user={user}
                          changeHandler={this.inputChangeHandler}
                          onSubmit={this.login} />;
        case 'garage':
            return <Garage logoutHandler={this.logoutHandler}/>;
        default:
            return <Login error={error}
                          user={user}
                          changeHandler={this.inputChangeHandler}
                          onSubmit={this.login}/>;
    }
};

render() {
    const content = this.contentForRoute();

    return (
        <Grid>
            {content}
        </Grid>
    );
};
